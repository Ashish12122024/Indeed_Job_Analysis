## Project Overview

The **Indeed Job Analysis** project aims to gather and analyze job postings from Indeed.com to provide insights into job trends, skills requirements, and salary distributions. Using web scraping, we collected data from Indeed's job listings, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights. This project helps job seekers, recruiters, and analysts understand the current job market better.

## Project Objectives

1. Scrape job data from Indeed, including job titles, companies, locations, salaries, and job descriptions.
2. Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the data for analysis.
3. Conduct exploratory data analysis to extract insights on job trends, skill demands, location-based trends, and salary distributions.
4. Visualize the findings to provide clear and actionable insights.

## Skills and Tools Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** BeautifulSoup, Requests, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Collection:** Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup and Requests)
- **Data Analysis:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn

## Data Collection

Data for this project was scraped from Indeed.com using the BeautifulSoup library in Python. Job titles, companies, locations, estimated salaries, and descriptions were collected as part of the dataset. Data cleaning and preprocessing steps were applied to handle missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA phase focused on uncovering trends and insights within the data:

1. **Job Titles and Roles:** Analyzed the frequency of various job titles and identified popular roles.
2. **Company Insights:** Examined top companies hiring, job counts, and trends.
3. **Location-Based Analysis:** Determined job distribution by location.
4. **Salary Analysis:** Explored salary trends across job titles and locations.
5. **Skill Requirements:** Analyzed job descriptions to identify frequently requested skills.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run the Web Scraper:** Use the scripts in the `src/` directory to run the web scraper and save the data to the `data/` folder.
3. **Data Analysis:** Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to perform EDA and visualize the results.
4. **View Results:** Check the `results/` folder for visualizations and insights from the analysis.

## Conclusions

Based on the analysis, insights regarding job demand, salary ranges, and skill requirements can be drawn. These findings are helpful for job seekers and employers in understanding the current trends in the job market.

## Future Work

- Automate data scraping to update the dataset regularly.
- Perform sentiment analysis on job descriptions to gauge employer tone and requirements.
- Incorporate machine learning to predict job trends and salary ranges based on location and skills.
